# Tell me what you eat, I'll tell you where you're from

# Abstract

Each country has its own historical experience that has shaped its culture over the time. During this process, the food culture has also evolved differently in each part of the world, and regions have created and developed their affinity with certain food.

In this project, we want to highlight the food trend in each country and to realize their relation with the culture of the country. To this end, we have decided to use the Open Food Facts dataset, which will allow us to make those observations.

It might be interesting to see which kind of food is more sold and consumed in a country and to see if this is related to the country culture. These information can be then useful for people who like to travel and can help them to better understand the culture of a country.



# Research questions

- What type of food is eaten in which country?
- Do we see a correlation between the nutriments eaten in a country and the country itself?
- More precisely, is there a link between the food specialties in a country and its culture ?
- Is there a geographical interpretation of the kind of nutriments consumed in certain regions ?
- If we go deeper, does the type of food influence the way a country 

# Dataset

We will use the `Open Food Facts` dataset. The dataset is in CSV format and is not too big (1.6Gb), so it will be fine to work on only using Pandas. This dataset consists of multiple information about food products, as for example the name of products, the ingredients, the countries in which those products are sold and the nutrition properties of the product such as the sugar, the energy and so on.

We will try to extract some useful information about what people eat in the different regions of the world and what are the main nutrition elements they eat. We will try to see there is a correlation between the food and the location. This could be useful to orient the tourists on what to eat in which country.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2

Here is a non-exhaustive list of what we plan to do until milestone 2:
- Look for other dataset that can help us to highlight our future observations and give more meaning to our results
- Preprocessing : load and clean the dataset.
- Study carefully our dataset and extract the first useful information and attributes we want to observe.
- Think about ways to visualize / tell the story of our data and see what can be shown.
- Make a list of our expectations concerning the results.


# Questions for TAs

We don't have specific questions at the moment, but we will ask the TAs if there is any during the process of our project.
